Conversely, sampling locations EPA datasets chosen randomly, collected two-year phases 4 years phases. standardize refers whether abundance values site taxa matrix standardized unit effort (individuals per unit effort per meter sampled). Specifically, standardize = \"CPUE\" results abundances divided seconds shocked, number seine hauls, etc. values divided stream length sampled. standardize = \"MGMS\", abundances standardized CPUE, mean total CPUE (summation CPUEs taxa site collection date) calculated sampling method. CPUE value divided mean total CPUE mean total CPUE respective sampling methods. MGMS one row time-location function standardizes sampling method addition area sampled, meaning resulting abundance values summed sampling methods time-location sampling event. See supplement Gibson-Reinemer et al.¬†(2017) example MGMS computation. highly recommended users set standardize either ‚ÄúCPUE\" \"MGMS\" interested comparing abundance values across sites. Note: ~35 samples lacked required standardization information. Therefore, interested occurrence (presence/absence) data , set standardize = \"none\" dataType = \"occur\". Users aware setting standardize = \"none\" result larger dataset additional samples/sites standardize = \"CPUE\" standardize = \"MGMS\". hybrid refers whether output dataset include fish identified hybrids two species. conversations fish experts, recommend keeping set default hybrid = FALSE, hybrids notoriously difficult identify may equate unique species. Finally, boatableStreams refers whether boatable streams included EPA dataset.
