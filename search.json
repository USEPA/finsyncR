Abundance values densities (number organisms per m2) occurrence values presence (1) absence (0). taxonLevel refers taxonomic resolution (Genus, Class, Family, etc.) sample taxa matrix. input values parameter case sensitive must start capital letter. observations taxonomically coarser taxonLevel provided dropped output community matrix. instance, taxonLevel = \"Genus\" , observations identified Family, Order, Class, Phylum levels dropped. ‚ÄúGenus‚Äù finest level taxonomic resolution provided macroinvertebrates. package provide USGS species-level identifications two reasons. First, limit USGS identification genus-level make EPA USGS data comparable. Second, species-level identifications groups macroinvertebrates inherently difficult make, limit identifications genus-level avoid potentially inaccurate identifications. Across time span USGS EPA macroinvertebrate datasets, taxonomy many macroinvertebrates changed, specifically membership species within genera. taxonFix provides options harmonize taxonomy time, especially instances membership given organism within genus clear. certain scenarios given organism may identified genus lab bench, yet taxonomic updates occurred, species within originally designated genus moved different genus. scenario prevents confident identification given organism‚Äôs ‚Äútrue‚Äù genus possible organism question might belong original genus new, updated genus. instance, consider organism identified hypothetical genus Hereiam. time identification, two species within genus: Hereiam Hereiam . time since identification lab, taxonomy reorganized, presently genus Hereiam contains one species Hereiam , new genus created. Hereiam now Thereiam . , unclear whether organism, originally identified Hereiam belongs Hereiam Thereiam updates taxonomy. issue especially difficult overcome attempting harmonize samples identified taxonomic update occurred. package provides three options accounting changes taxonomy time using parameter taxonFix. First, default option, taxonFix = ‚Äúlump‚Äù, creates complexes genera combining possible genera given organism. approach prioritizes retaining observations organisms giving unified name (e.g.¬†genus1/genus2/genus3) complex genera linked changes taxonomy time. approach, temporal increase decrease number genera, given individual genera (e.g.¬†genus1) never appear outside unified genera name (e.g.¬†genus1/genus2/genus3). Thus, hypothetical example , Hereiam Thereiam occur ‚ÄúHereiam/Thereiam‚Äù throughout generated dataset. total, 98 genera exist linked changes taxonomy time (Figure 2). approach described reduces 98 genera 13 complexes genera. two complexes genera composed two individual genera. single complex genera within Ephemeroptera order included 70 individual genera, second complex Ephemeroptera genera included six individual genera. complexity Ephemeroptera taxonomy, careful consideration given inferences can made evaluating Ephemeroptera trends. authors, instance, advise users evaluate temporal changes abundance richness linked groups Ephemeroptera genera taxonomic reorganizations last decades likely obscure temporal patterns.  Figure 2. Visualization relationships among genera linked taxonomic reorganization time. numbered circle represents individual genus. Lines genera pairs indicate taxonomic designation least one species one genus pairs updated genus pair. Clusters (genera complexes) formed sets linked genera. See Appendix Table A1 table linking numbers cluster genera names.  second option, taxonFix = \"remove\", prioritizes accurate identification dropping observations confidently identified single genus, includes complexes genera previously described. addition, taxonFix = \"remove\" also removes organisms identified slash genera (e.g.¬†Cricotopus/Orthocladius), identifications given organisms identification multiple genera distinguished according identification key. , taxonFix = \"remove\" results dataset fewer genera compared dataset generated taxonFix = \"lump\". taxonFix = \"remove\" best option accurate identification high priority users. Finally, taxonFix = \"none\" makes adjustment returns identifications original forms. taxonFix = \"none\" option generates slash genera organisms given slash genus either time identification harmonize occurrences slash genera USGS EPA observations, described . taxonFix operates genus level, taxonFix must set \"none\" taxonLevel set ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù higher taxonomic resolution. Care taken harmonize taxonomy either approaches provided alternative long time scale datasets entire community macroinvertebrates generated changes taxonomy can make artificially appear though genera either appearing disappearing time. matter value provided taxonFix, taxonomy harmonized three additional ways appropriately join USGS EPA datasets. First, instances given organism identified species level genus given time identification updated new genus, package updates genus cross walking bench identification current genus (Hereiam becomes Thereiam previous example). Second, instances slash genus used consistently USGS EPA. hypothetical example, USGS data contains organism identified genus1/genus2, EPA data included separate identifications genus1 genus2. ensure consistency agencies, package renames single instances genus1 genus2 genus1/genus2 combining EPA USGS samples single dataset.
