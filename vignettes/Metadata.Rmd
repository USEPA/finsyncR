Column names are in the order of how they appear in each output dataset.

## Information shared across datasets

#### Agency

Description: Agency that oversaw the collection of the sample.

Categorical. Levels:

-   "EPA" - United States Environmental Protection Agency
-   "USGS" - United States Geological Survey

#### ProjectLabel

Description: Project short name assigned by the project owner. For USGS data, ProjectLabel is explicitly provided by the USGS. For EPA, ProjectLabelis the sampling round/type (e.g., NRSA0809).

Categorical.

#### SiteNumber

Description: Unique site identifiers. For USGS data, SiteNumber is USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) 8 to 15-digit identifier for the place for where sample was collected (preceeded by “USGS-”). For EPA data, SiteNumber is the NARS “SITE_ID” variable, with the preferred form of  NRS_MM-xxxxx, where MM is two letter state code, and xxxxx is between 10001 and 99999. EPA unique site ID (UNIQUE_ID) is used in place of SITE_ID , to link sites temporally. SITE_IDs from individual rounds of NRSA sampling (WSA/EMAP included) were linked to a site-level UNIQUE_ID, so that sites that were resampled through time could be linked. If sites could not be linked to a UNIQUE_ID, survey-specific SITE_ID is used instead.

Categorical. EPA preferred form is NRS_MM-xxxxx, where MM is two letter state code, and xxxxx is between 10001 and 99999. USGS form is USGS-xxxxxxxx, where xxxxxxxx is the 8 to 15-digit USGS NWIS identifier.

Note: To link EPA unique site IDs to survey-specific site IDs (e.g., to be used to link them to other NARS collected data), users can link unified site IDs to the survey-specific ID using the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
dataset$SurveySpecificSiteID <-
  ifelse(dataset$SiteNumber %in% finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$UNIQUE_ID,
         finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$SITE_ID[
           match(dataset$SiteNumber,
                 finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$UNIQUE_ID)],
         ifelse(dataset$SiteNumber %in% finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$MASTER_SITEID,
                finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$SITE_ID[
                  match(dataset$SiteNumber,
                        finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$MASTER_SITEID)],
                dataset$SiteNumber))
```

#### COMID

Description: Waterbody unique identifier from US National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus).

Integer.

#### StreamOrder

Description: Strahler stream order. Moving waters of the first order are the outermost tributaries. If two streams of the same order merge, the resulting stream is given a number that is one higher. If two rivers with different stream orders merge, the resulting stream is given the higher of the two numbers.

Integer.

#### WettedWidth

Description: Provided for EPA samples only. Measured distance from left to right bank of the stream channel filled with water. Meters.

Numeric.

#### PredictedWettedWidth

Description: Predicted distance from left to right bank of the stream channel filled with water. Gathered from StreamCat and Doyle, Jessie M., Hill, Ryan A., Leibowitz, Scott G. and Ebersole, Joseph L.. 2023. \"Random forest models to estimate bankfull and low flow channel widths and depths across the conterminous United States.\" *JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association* 59(5): 1099--1114. <https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13116>.
