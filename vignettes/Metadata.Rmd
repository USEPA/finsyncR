Column names are in the order of how they appear in each output dataset.

## Information shared across datasets

#### Agency

Description: Agency that oversaw the collection of the sample.

Categorical. Levels:

-   "EPA" - United States Environmental Protection Agency
-   "USGS" - United States Geological Survey

#### ProjectLabel

Description: Project short name assigned by the project owner; for USGS data this is explicitly defined by the USGS, for EPA this has been defined as the sampling round/type (e.g., NRSA0809).

Categorical.

#### SiteNumber

Description: Unique site identifiers. For USGS data, USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) 8 to 15-digit identifier for the place for where sample was collected (preceeded by "USGS-"). For EPA data, for the study and year sampled. EPA preferred form is NRS_MM-xxxxx, where MM is two letter state code, and xxxxx is between 10001 and 99999. EPA unique site ID (UNIQUE_ID) is used in place of SITE_ID. SITE_IDs from individual rounds of NRSA sampling (WSA/EMAP included) were linked to a site-level UNIQUE_ID, so that sites that were resampled through time could be linked. If sites could not be linked to a UNIQUE_ID, survey-specific SITE_ID is used instead.

Categorical. EPA preferred form is NRS_MM-xxxxx, where MM is two letter state code, and xxxxx is between 10001 and 99999.

Note: To link EPA unique site IDs to survey-specific site IDs (e.g., to be used to link them to other NARS collected data), users can link unified site IDs to the survey-specific ID using the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
dataset$SurveySpecificSiteID <-
  ifelse(dataset$SiteNumber %in% finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$UNIQUE_ID,
         finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$SITE_ID[
           match(dataset$SiteNumber,
                 finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$UNIQUE_ID)],
         ifelse(dataset$SiteNumber %in% finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$MASTER_SITEID,
                finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$SITE_ID[
                  match(dataset$SiteNumber,
                        finsyncR:::.NRSA_siteIDs$MASTER_SITEID)],
                dataset$SiteNumber))
```
