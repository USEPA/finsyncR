### Site-level Information

#### SiteNumber
Description: USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) 8 to 15-digit identifier for the place for where sample was collected.

Note: Be aware that there are leading zeros in these site numbers. Thus, when working with these data, it is advised that you should either add alphabetical characters in front of the site number (i.e., `paste("USGS-", Invertdata$SiteNumber, sep = "")`) or when reading in a saved dataset, use the `"colClasses = c("SiteNumber" = "character")"` option in `read.csv()`.

#### SiteName
Description: USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) name for the place where sample was collected.

#### StudyReachName
Description: Name given to identify the longitudinal section of a stream that was selected for sampling.

#### SiteTypeName
Description: Name of hydrologic setting of the site such as stream, canal, ditch, lake, wetland, etc.

### StateFIPSCode
Description: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code (two digits) for the state in which the site is located.

Note: Be aware that there are leading zeros in these site numbers. Thus, when working with these data, it is advised that you should either add alphabetical characters in front of the site number (i.e., `paste("S-", Invertdata$StateFIPSCode, sep = "")`) or when reading in a saved dataset, use the `colClasses = c("StateFIPSCode" = "character")` option in `read.csv()`.

#### CountyFIPSCode
Description: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code (three digits) for the county in which the site is located. 

Note: Be aware that there are leading zeros in these site numbers. Thus, when working with these data, it is advised that you should either add alphabetical characters in front of the FIPS code (i.e., `paste("C-", Invertdata$CountyFIPSCode, sep = "")`) or when reading in a saved dataset, use the `colClasses = c("CountyFIPSCode" = "character")` option in `read.csv()`.

#### Latitude_dd
Description: Latitude of the site location, in decimal degrees

#### Longitude_dd
Description: Longitude of the site location, in decimal degrees

#### CoordinateDatum
Description: Datum of site location coordinates

#### HUCCode
Description: Hydrologic unit code (HUC) in which the site is located. Hydrologic units are geographic areas representing part or all of a surface drainage basin or distinct hydrologic feature and are delineated on the State Hydrologic Unit Maps. Each hydrologic unit is identified by a unique number (HUC), and a name. Additional information is available from the USGS Hydrologic Unit web site <http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html>

#### DrainageArea_mi2
Description: Area enclosed by a topographic divide from which direct surface runoff drains to the site, in square miles.


## Dataset specific information

### Inverts

#### SampleTypeCode
Description: Code indicating the type of sample collected
Levels:

* IRTH - NAWQA Invertebrate Targeted Habitat
* BERW - NRSA Invertebrate, wadable, reach-wide benthos

#### IdentificationEntity
Description: Organization or entity that identified the specimens

#### AreaSampTot_m2
Description: Total area sampled, in square meters.

#### GeomorphicChannelUnit
Description: The types of geomorphic channel units where sample was collected.

#### ChannelBoundaries
Description: General areas within the channel where sample was collected.

#### ChannelFeatures
Description: Channel feature(s) where sample was taken.

#### ReplicateType
Description: Code to indicate whether sample is a field-collection replicate
Levels:

* N - Sample is not a replicate
* Y - Sample is a replicate

Note: These replicates were maintained in the invert dataset, because they sampled different geomorphic channel units, which might influence the taxa that are present within the sample. For the limited number of samples that are true field replicates, data users will need to use either one of the samples, to take the average of the samples, or to account for the replicate by using a random term in their models, depending on the question being addressed with the data. For all other datasets, averages were taken of replicate samples.

### Fish

#### MethodCode
Description: Code that identifies method used to collect the specimen(s). Electrofishing MethodCodes indicate gear type used and pass number or subreach (e.g. Backpack-P1).

#### MethodBasic
Description: Simplified version of `MethodCode`. All electrofishing (boats, backpack, etc.) has been reclassified as "Shocking". All netting has been reclassified as "Seine". Snorkel samples have been classified as "Snorkel".

#### ReachLengthFished_m
Description: Length of stream covered by fishing activities conducted for this sample. Typically this will be equal to the curvilinear reach length of the assigned study reach.

#### NumberSeineHauls
Description: Number of times a seine was set and retrieved from the water.

Note: This column will only have non-zero values for seine samples.

#### NumberStationarySetsKicks
Description: Number of times a stationary kick-seine method was used.

Note: This column will only have non-zero values for kick-seine samples.

#### NumberSnorkelingTransects
Description: Number of transects snorkeled within a reach.

Note: This column will only have non-zero values for snorkel samples.

#### MinutesShockTime
Description: Actual time (in minutes) that electrofisher is on; the time electricity is being transmitted to the water.

Note: This column will only have non-zero values for electroshocking samples.

#### StandardMethod
Description: The value by which the number of individuals of each species is divided to obtain an abundance value that is standardized by unit effort. Specifically, this number is `ReachLengthFished_m` multiplied by the effort (values in one of `NumberSeineHauls`, `NumberStationarySetsKicks`, `NumberSnorkelingTransects`, or `MinutesShockTime`). 

Note: This column will only be present when `standardize = TRUE` in the `getFishData()` function.


### Algae

#### SampleTypeCode
Description: Code indicating the type of sample collected
Domain:

* Phytoplankton samples    
    + ARTH - NAWQA Periphyton Richest Targeted Habitat
    + ADTH - NAWQA Periphyton Depositional Targeted Habitat
    + AQMH - NAWQA Periphyton Multiple Habitat **These samples only appear when** `AlgType = "Peri"` **AND** `AbunType = "Occur"`
   
* Periphyton samples
    + APHY - NAWQA Phytoplankton

#### SamplingMethodOrDevice
Description: Method or device for collecting sample. 

#### PeriphytonHabitatsSampled
Description: The benthic habitat upon which the organisms were attached or loosely associated (Epilithic, Epidendric, Epiphytic, Epipsammic, Epipelic, Artificial substrate).

Note: This column only appears when `AlgType = "Peri"`.

#### SubsurfaceGrabDepth_m
Description: Depth of subsurface grab sample, in meters.

Note: This column only appears when `AlgType = "Phyto"`.


## Information on taxa columns
Following all of the above columns are an unknown number of columns that code for the unique taxa found in each dataset at the specific taxonomic resolution (phylum through subspecies). The values in these columns will either code for abundance or occurrence (presence/absence, coded as 1/0). These values default to density estimates for each taxa. For inverts, it is individuals per m^2^; for periphyton, it is cells per cm^2^; for phytoplankton, it is cells per mL; and for fish, it is individuals per unit effort per meter(i.e., for electroshocking: individuals per minute shocking per meter). However, these units become raw abundance values when AbunMeasure = "Abundance" in `getInvertData()` only. Further, within `getFishData()`, when standardize = "FALSE", the values become individuals per meter, but using unstandardized data here is not recommended. 

```{r example, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(StreamData)

Invertdata = getInvertData(taxonLevel = "Family")
colnames(Invertdata)[1:32]

```
