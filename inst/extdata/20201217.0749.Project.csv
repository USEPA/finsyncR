Public,"",Big Wood River Bioassessment,BigWoodRiv,USGS_BioData-000000076,Idaho Water Science Center,"The human population in Blaine County, Idaho has nearly quadrupled from about 5,700 to 22,000 people between 1970 and 2010. Residents and resource managers of the Wood River Valley of south-central Idaho are concerned about the potential effects that population growth and the expected increased demand for water might have on the quantity and quality of the valley’s ground- and surface waters. Increased water use has the potential to negatively impact streamflow, water quality, and the biological integrity in the Wood River and its tributaries. A comprehensive assessment of the current condition of water quantity, quality, and aquatic biology of the Wood River and its major tributaries was completed in September 2014 as a means for the establishment of a robust, objective baseline for a trend monitoring. Sampling reaches were co-located with active USGS streamgages for evaluation of flow alteration. Water-quality samples were collected for nutrient, bacteria, and suspended sediment analysis. Continuous temperature data were collected during the critical summer months. Algae (periphyton), macroinvertebrate, and fish and associated habitats were sampled from representative reaches on the Big Wood River, major tributary locations, and one site on Silver Creek.

Water quality parameters for this project can be found national water information system (NWIS) water quaity database at URL: https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/id/nwis/qwdata.

Public,"",Blue River Urban Watershed Assessment,BLUERQW,USGS_BioData-000000116,Missouri Water Science Center,"The Blue River in Missouri and Kansas has many potential sources for contamination including nonpoint-source runoff, waste water treatment plants, and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Also, continued urban development adds additional pressure to the system. Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO) is working to address CSOs while other programs are working to address flooding within the city, including channelization projects to increase high flow conveyance and grade control structures. A primary objective of the &quot;Renew the Blue&quot; program is increasing public connection to the River, with proposed boat ramps and urban trails and parks along the river that connect across the KCMO metropolitan area. The Partnership Ambassador (Heartland Conservation Alliance) and KCMO are focusing on habitat restoration along the Blue River and activities to connect the urban population to the river. As a result, substantial changes to the system have occurred. However, there is a lack of recent information regarding riparian and instream habitats and stream ecological quality in the Blue River, making it difficult to understand the effects of these changes.

Biological assessments were conducted by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 2007 and an urban intensity index was developed using habitat assessment, macroinvertebrate, and water quality data to correlate urban intensity with macroinvertebrate community characteristics. Many changes have occurred within the Blue River watershed since those early assessments and the Blue River information is now outdated and does not include fish. Currently, the USGS has much information about the Little Blue River and this project will expand information for the Blue River. Assessment of the five Blue River Watershed sites will include habitat, fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities, and water quality. In addition, five sites that are identified by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MODNR) as being minimally impacted by human activities will be included as habitat and macroinvertebrate reference conditions.",Cooperative Water Program,Blue River Federal Urban Waters Program
Public,"",Boise River Water Quality,BoiseR WQ,USGS_BioData-000000044,Idaho Water Science Center,"Between 1990 and 2005, Ada and Canyon County population increased nearly 60% to 509,320, and is expected to continue growing over the next ten years*. The lower Boise basin contains the most industrialized and urbanized areas in Idaho.

Within the last century, the lower Boise River has been transformed from a meandering, braided, gravel-bed river that supported large runs of salmon to a channelized, regulated, urban river that provides flood control and irrigation to over 1,200 mi2 of land. 

Several lower Boise River tributaries are interconnected by a complex irrigation system of canals, laterals, and drains. Flow in the lower Boise between Lucky Peak Dam and the mouth is primarily controlled by reservoir regulation; irrigation withdrawals and return flows; and seepage of shallow groundwater. Three upper basin reservoirs have a combined storage capacity of approximately 1 million acre-ft. These reservoirs are primarily managed for irrigation and flood control, and secondarily for recreation and power generation.

The water quality and biotic integrity of the lower Boise River between Lucky Peak Dam and the river's mouth near Parma, Idaho, have been adversely affected by many factors:

Urban and residential development 
Agricultural land and water use  
Wastewater-treatment facility discharge 
Road construction 
Urban runoff 
Confined-animal feeding operations 
Reservoir operations 
River channelization

In 1992 the lower Boise River Watershed Council (LBWC) was formed to identify nutrient and suspended sediment sources; initiate voluntary water-quality management practices; and monitor the long-term effectiveness of these practices on the river's water quality and biotic integrity.

In October 1994, the lower Boise River and some of its tributaries were listed as water-quality limited in accordance with paragraph 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1994). Beneficial uses of the Boise River include domestic water supply, agricultural water supply, coldwater biota, salmonid spawning, primary and secondary recreation. Pollutants in the Lower Boise are sediment, dissolved oxygen fluctuations, oil and grease, nutrients, temperature, and bacteria. 

Monitoring of water quality and biological integrity began in 1994 using standard USGS protocols for water quality and NAWQA protocols for biological integrity assessments. Macroinvertebrate and Fish community data prior to 2011 has been stored in an on-line database at http://greatbasin.wr.usgs.gov/fish/

Chlorophyll a and biomass concentration from periphyton samples were also taken at the time of macroinvertebrate collection.

Public,"",Fountain Creek,FountainCk,USGS_BioData-000000098,Colorado Water Science Center,"The Fountain Creek basin drains approximately 926 mi2 of the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in south-central Colorado.  Several environmental factors that influence stream communities have been altered throughout the Fountain Creek basin (for example, habitat alteration and riparian disturbance), which began in the mid-1800s.  Several studies of Fountain Creek basin have described patterns in surface-water hydrology and water chemistry (Edelmann and others, 2002; Stogner, 2000), and sediment transport (von Guerard, 1989), and other studies have related some of these characteristics to urbanization and biological communities (Zuellig and others, 2007).  Continued alteration of environmental factors is expected in the future as human population grows, especially in regards to surface-water hydrology, which could further influence water quality, in-stream habitat, and ultimately, biological communities.
Local, State, and Federal agencies are interested in better understanding the relations between environmental character¬istics and biological communities in the Fountain Creek basin in order to aid water-resource management and guide future monitoring activities.

The USGS and the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW, now Colorado Parks and Wildlife, CPW) work cooperatively to collect the fish-sample data.

Wichita is using artificial recharge via the Equus Beds Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) Program to replenish the aquifer and slow down chloride migration to preserve current and future water supply. Artificial recharge has been implemented in several phases; Phase II includes a hydrobiological monitoring program (HBMP). HBMP is using real-time surface and ground water monitoring, discrete water-quality sampling, as well as biological monitoring (macroinvertebrate and fish communities) to assess effects of ASR-related activities. In addition to standard (temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, etc.) real-time monitoring parameters, HBMP includes colored dissolved organic material (CDOM) sensors in both ground and surface water as well as a nitrate monitor in surface water.

Public,Provisional,Independence Storm Water Quality,INDEPQW,USGS_BioData-000000088,Missouri Water Science Center,"The Little Blue River receives the majority of the discharge from the Independence municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). The Clean Water Act requires that National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for discharges from the MS4 have controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. A study by USGS in cooperation with the City of Independence to monitor the effectiveness of Independence’s stormwater program under the city’s NPDES permit was initiated in 2005. Additional information about the specific sources of contaminants observed in receiving streams is needed to help design feasible and effective strategies for further contaminant reductions. Sub-watershed monitoring, sampling, and other data collection and analysis tools are being used to help identify contaminant sources within Independence as well as monitoring pollutant contributions and loads entering the city from upstream. The Little Blue River was placed on the Missouri 303(d) list for bacteria pollution (E. coli) in 2012.

Water-quality and biologic data are collected for analysis at six gaged and three ungaged sites for urban streams. Gage sites are equipped to measure discharge and continuous water-quality parameters. Base- and stormflow water-quality and microbiological samples are collected monthly at gaged and un-gaged sites during the recreation season (April through October) and on a semi-monthly basis at the six gaged sites the rest of the year. Dry-weather (base-flow) screening of Independence streams is conducted annually on a rotating basis to identify point sources. Macroinvertebrate samples are collected during the spring and fall every other year. Annual data reports of the collected data are provided to the City of Independence for submittal to Missouri DNR in support of NPDES permit requirements for the MS4.

Public,"",Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin Eco Assessment,MITW Eco,USGS_BioData-000000096,Wisconsin Water Science Center,"The U.S. Geological Survey sampled algal and invertebrate assemblages together with water chemistry in October 2000 as part of a water-quality reconnaissance of 12 streams in the Menominee Indian Reservation of Wisconsin. The Menominee Tribe was interested in baseline information in order to develop water-quality and watershed management plans to help conserve and protect current conditions, and to assess possible effects of upstream non-reservation activities on reservation water quality. The Reservation is a remainder of the tribe's ancestral lands, and most of this land has been used for sustainable forestry since the mid-1800s. It is a relatively pristine area in the Northern Lakes and Forests ecoregion. The invertebrate sampling used a qualitative assessment of multiple habitats in order to maximize the chances of including rare taxa of interest. Indexes based on invertebrate assemblages indicated good to excellent water quality at most stream sites. The algal sampling used a quantitative assessment of woody snags, estimated to be the richest habitat in these streams.  Incorporation of biological sampling into the water-chemistry study was relatively simple and inexpensive, and the resultant data provides important complementary information on water-quality conditions in the Reservation.

Invertebrate samples were collected using a 500 micrometer mesh dip net and the NAWQA invertebrate QMH methods (equal time) for a 300 m reach. All invertebrate ID and enumeration was done by the USGS NWQL (Denver) using the 100-count method (Schedule 2174). Algal samples were collected using the NAWQA algal RTH method for epidendric (snag) habitats.

Phase I of the study involved the compilation of existing data from multiple agencies into a single database.  These data were analyzed to identify gaps in planning area data and were used to develop Phase II of the study.  Phase II involved an intensive data-collection effort by the USGS in cooperation with MMSD that completed a baseline assessment of water quality for selected stream and harbor sites in the MMSD planning area.  This baseline assessment included evaluations of surface-water chemistry and microbial concentrations in the streams and harbor sites, and bioassessments using passive samplers for synthetic organic chemicals (SPMDs), fish-tissue chemistry, stream habitat, and the quality of biological communities (fish, macroinvertebrates, and algae) at 14 wadable stream sites in 2004.  For Phase III, bioassessments were done again in 2007 and 2010 at most of the same stream sites.

In the spring and early summer, NAWQA will sample streams weekly for contaminants, nutrients, and sediment. During the same time period, CERC will test sediment and water samples for toxicity, deploy time-integrating samplers, and measure reproductive effects and biomarkers of contaminant exposure in fish or amphibians. NRSA will sample sites once during the summer to assess ecological and habitat conditions in the streams by collecting data on algal, macroinvertebrate, and fish communities and collecting detailed physical-habitat measurements.

Since 1997 these study reaches have been sampled every 3 years to assess trends in aquatic resource conditions.  Instantaneous water quality parameters of pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature will be measured at the time of sampling. Macroinvertebrate semi-quantitative samples will be collected from riffle habitats in each study reach.  Macroinvertebrate taxa will be reported as number per unit area for riffle samples.  A qualitative sample will be done within each reach and the results will include a complete inventory of species collected. A fish community assessment will be made within the reach.  All fish captured will be identified, counted, measured and examined for external anomalies.  Microhabitat measures of riffle habitats will also be taken including velocity, depth, percent fines and embeddedness, and percent canopy opening.  Deliverables to the sponsor will include a tabulation of the data in excel spreadsheets.  The data will also be made available on the Idaho Water Science Center web site. Idaho Department of Fish and Game biologists and TNC volunteers will assist with fish sampling.

In 1997, the USGS joined the effort to monitor aquatic communities in the Silver Creek watershed. We measure streamflow, water-quality, and aquatic biology conditions and help assess whether habitation restoration efforts have been successful. With its partners, the USGS operates a streamgage on Silver Creek at the sportsman access near Picabo, ID. This gage collects discharge (flow), gage height, and temperature measurements every 15 minutes and disseminates them to the USGS National Water Information System Web Interface (NWIS Web) every hour. Every three years, we collect instantaneous water-quality samples to measure pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature at this site and one further upstream. These data will be available on NWIS Web after they have been reviewed and approved.

During the instantaneous water-quality sample collection, USGS scientists and technicians also collect, identify, examine, and count macroinvertebrates and fish at the two Silver Creek sites to identify long-term trends in biological communities. Also, at riffles, we measure flow and depth; riverbed material (percent fines and embeddedness); and riparian growth (percent of canopy opening). Data collected prior to 2010 are available from the USGS Fish On-line Web site. Data collect after 2010 are available from the USGS BioData Web site.
Habitat restoration assessment.

The Nature Conservancy has made instream improvements in Patton Creek which is a tributary of Silver Creek. Since 2011, we have conducted seasonal macroinvertebrate assessments in three reaches of Patton Creek. We identify macroinvertebrate taxa (abundance per unit area). We also measure riffle microhabitat conditions such as water velocity and depth; riverbed material (percent fines and embeddedness); and riparian growth (percent of canopy opening). These data are available from the USGS BioData Web site. This assessment will be completed in 2013.",Cooperative Water Program,""

The Little White River drains approximately one-half of Todd County.  In 2004, the South Dakota Integrated Report for Surface Water Quality Assessment listed the Little White River for exceedance of suspended sediment concentrations.  This lead to the investigation of sediment concentrations within the Little White River as well the collection of a wider range of water quality constituents and benthic macroinvertebrates from which the Rosebud Sioux Tribe would have a better understanding of the concentration levels within the Reservation but also detail of which areas might be of more concern or higher constituent loading.  Benthic sampling, which took place at three locations long the Little White River, provided indications of how water quality changes in the river reach might be impacting stream health.  Benthic metric results generally followed a pattern indicating decreases in stream health from the site near Vetal (Bennett/Todd county line) to the site above Rosebud and then increased stream health downstream near the Todd/Mellette County line.

Physical properties, major ions, trace elements, nutrients, bacteria, benthic macroinvertebrates, organic (wastewater) compounds, bottom sediment, and suspended sediment are summarized for samples collected from 2 sites on Cold Spring Creek, 2 sites on Beaver Creek, and 1 site on Highland Creek. None of the constituent concentrations for any of the samples collected during 2002-03 exceeded any of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking-water standards, with the exception of the Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level for pH, which was exceeded in numerous samples from Beaver Creek and Highland Creek. Additionally, the pH values in several of these same samples also exceeded beneficial-use criteria for coldwater permanent fisheries and coldwater marginal fisheries. Water temperature exceeded the coldwater permanent fisheries criterion in numerous samples from all three streams. Two samples from Highland Creek also exceeded the coldwater marginal fisheries criterion for water temperature.  Samples for the analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates were collected from one site on each of the three streams during July 2002 and May 2003. The benthic macroinvertebrate data showed that Beaver Creek had lower species diversity and a higher percentage of tolerant species than the other two streams during 2002, but just the opposite was found during 2003. However, examination of the complete data set indicates that the quality of water at the upstream site was generally poorer than the quality of water at the downstream site. Furthermore, the quality of water at the upstream site on Beaver Creek is somewhat degraded when compared to the quality of water from Highland and Cold Spring Creeks, indicating that anthropogenic activities outside the park probably are affecting the quality of water in Beaver Creek.
