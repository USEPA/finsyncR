Public,"",Big Wood River Bioassessment,BigWoodRiv,USGS_BioData-000000076,Idaho Water Science Center,"The human population in Blaine County, Idaho has nearly quadrupled from about 5,700 to 22,000 people between 1970 and 2010. Residents and resource managers of the Wood River Valley of south-central Idaho are concerned about the potential effects that population growth and the expected increased demand for water might have on the quantity and quality of the valley’s ground- and surface waters. Increased water use has the potential to negatively impact streamflow, water quality, and the biological integrity in the Wood River and its tributaries. A comprehensive assessment of the current condition of water quantity, quality, and aquatic biology of the Wood River and its major tributaries was completed in September 2014 as a means for the establishment of a robust, objective baseline for a trend monitoring. Sampling reaches were co-located with active USGS streamgages for evaluation of flow alteration. Water-quality samples were collected for nutrient, bacteria, and suspended sediment analysis. Continuous temperature data were collected during the critical summer months. Algae (periphyton), macroinvertebrate, and fish and associated habitats were sampled from representative reaches on the Big Wood River, major tributary locations, and one site on Silver Creek.

Water quality parameters for this project can be found national water information system (NWIS) water quaity database at URL: https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/id/nwis/qwdata.  Chlorophyll a and biomass concentration from periphyton samples were also taken at the time of macroinvertebrate collection and the data stored in NWIS.

Public,"",Biological Assessment of Streams in Marion County,Marion,USGS_BioData-000000067,Indiana Water Science Center,"Data Types: Benthic Invertebrates, Fish, and Streambed Sediment Chemistry

Project Duration:  Benthic samples for DPW related to CSO's and changes to the WWTF started in 1981-87 with 3 sites for Charlie Crawford's work, then from 1994-1996 at 21 sites for Danny Renn's work, 12 sites for Voelker from 1999-2001, and 13 sites for Voelker 2003-2008, and 13 sites for Voelker 2009-2013.

Data Methods: 

Benthic invertebrates: 3 separate Surber (210 micron mesh) samplers are used to collect invertebrates. These are processed individually by the lab and then combined to come up with one data set per site. Sites are sampled twice per year in Spring and Fall.

Fish: Follow NAWQA protocols for electrofishing. Use boat, tote barge, and backpack shocker as appropriate. Fish communities are sampled once every other year (2010, 2012).

Bed Sediment Chemistry: Follow USGS methods outlined in Radtke, 1997. Samples are analyzed for physical properties, metals, insecticides, herbicides, and semi-volatile compounds. (Analysis by NWQL and Geologic Division labs.) Sites sampled every other year (2009, 2011).

Project Description:  This study will analyze biotic communities - including fish and benthic invertebrates - as indicators of environmental quality in streams and rivers in Marion County. Benthic invertebrates will be sampled and described using indices such as the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) Index, Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), Invertebrate Community Index (ICI), as well as such metrics as percent of pollution tolerant versus intolerant species present at a site. Fish communities will be assessed using an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), and overall habitat conditions can be described using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI). These indices will be used to describe the general health of the aquatic environment at study sites. Streambed sediment samples also will be collected and analyzed for concentrations of selected metals, insecticides, herbicides, and organic compounds sorbed on the streambed sediments.",Cooperative Water Program,"Indianapolis Department of Public Works, Citizens Water Utilities"
Public,"",Boise River Water Quality,BoiseR WQ,USGS_BioData-000000044,Idaho Water Science Center,"Between 1990 and 2005, Ada and Canyon County population increased nearly 60% to 509,320, and is expected to continue growing over the next ten years*. The lower Boise basin contains the most industrialized and urbanized areas in Idaho.

Within the last century, the lower Boise River has been transformed from a meandering, braided, gravel-bed river that supported large runs of salmon to a channelized, regulated, urban river that provides flood control and irrigation to over 1,200 mi2 of land. 

Several lower Boise River tributaries are interconnected by a complex irrigation system of canals, laterals, and drains. Flow in the lower Boise between Lucky Peak Dam and the mouth is primarily controlled by reservoir regulation; irrigation withdrawals and return flows; and seepage of shallow groundwater. Three upper basin reservoirs have a combined storage capacity of approximately 1 million acre-ft. These reservoirs are primarily managed for irrigation and flood control, and secondarily for recreation and power generation.

The water quality and biotic integrity of the lower Boise River between Lucky Peak Dam and the river's mouth near Parma, Idaho, have been adversely affected by many factors:

Urban and residential development 
Agricultural land and water use  
Wastewater-treatment facility discharge 
Road construction 
Urban runoff 
Confined-animal feeding operations 
Reservoir operations 
River channelization

In 1992 the lower Boise River Watershed Council (LBWC) was formed to identify nutrient and suspended sediment sources; initiate voluntary water-quality management practices; and monitor the long-term effectiveness of these practices on the river's water quality and biotic integrity.

In October 1994, the lower Boise River and some of its tributaries were listed as water-quality limited in accordance with paragraph 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1994). Beneficial uses of the Boise River include domestic water supply, agricultural water supply, coldwater biota, salmonid spawning, primary and secondary recreation. Pollutants in the Lower Boise are sediment, dissolved oxygen fluctuations, oil and grease, nutrients, temperature, and bacteria. 

Monitoring of water quality and biological integrity began in 1994 using standard USGS protocols for water quality and NAWQA protocols for biological integrity assessments. Macroinvertebrate and Fish community data prior to 2011 has been stored in an on-line database at http://greatbasin.wr.usgs.gov/fish/

Chlorophyll a and biomass concentration from periphyton samples were also taken at the time of macroinvertebrate collection.

Public,"",Fountain Creek,FountainCk,USGS_BioData-000000098,Colorado Water Science Center,"The Fountain Creek basin drains approximately 926 mi2 of the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in south-central Colorado.  Several environmental factors that influence stream communities have been altered throughout the Fountain Creek basin (for example, habitat alteration and riparian disturbance), which began in the mid-1800s.  Several studies of Fountain Creek basin have described patterns in surface-water hydrology and water chemistry (Edelmann and others, 2002; Stogner, 2000), and sediment transport (von Guerard, 1989), and other studies have related some of these characteristics to urbanization and biological communities (Zuellig and others, 2007).  Continued alteration of environmental factors is expected in the future as human population grows, especially in regards to surface-water hydrology, which could further influence water quality, in-stream habitat, and ultimately, biological communities.
Local, State, and Federal agencies are interested in better understanding the relations between environmental character¬istics and biological communities in the Fountain Creek basin in order to aid water-resource management and guide future monitoring activities.

The USGS and the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW, now Colorado Parks and Wildlife, CPW) work cooperatively to collect the fish-sample data.

Wichita is using artificial recharge via the Equus Beds Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) Program to replenish the aquifer and slow down chloride migration to preserve current and future water supply. Artificial recharge has been implemented in several phases; Phase II includes a hydrobiological monitoring program (HBMP). HBMP is using real-time surface and ground water monitoring, discrete water-quality sampling, as well as biological monitoring (macroinvertebrate and fish communities) to assess effects of ASR-related activities. In addition to standard (temperature, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, etc.) real-time monitoring parameters, HBMP includes colored dissolved organic material (CDOM) sensors in both ground and surface water as well as a nitrate monitor in surface water. These innovative technologies allow broader monitoring capabilities, such as quantifying carbon from ASR processing entering groundwater via recharge. http://ks.water.usgs.gov/equus-beds-recharge",Cooperative Water Program,City of Wichita Kansas
Public,Provisional,Illinois River Urban Ag study,IllRAgUrb,USGS_BioData-000000063,Arkansas Water Science Center,"The purpose of this project is to describe biological communities (periphyton, macroinvertebrates, and fish) and relate the communities to nutrient concentrations, land use, nutrients and other environmental factors in the Illinois River Basin of Arkansas. Biological, habitat, and nutrient data at 18 sites was collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Sites were selected based on drainage area, land use, presence or absence of an upstream wastewater-treatment plant, water quality, and other information gathered during the reconnaissance. An important consideration in the process was to select sites along gradients of forest to urban land use and forest to agricultural land use. Water-quality samples were collected for analysis of nutrients, and a multiparameter field meter was used to measure water temperature, specific conductance, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Streamflow was measured immediately following the water-quality sampling. Macroalgae coverage was estimated and periphyton, macroinvertebrate, and fish communities were sampled at each site. Stream habitat also was assessed. Findings are published in the U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2014-5009 (http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20145009).

Phase I of the study involved the compilation of existing data from multiple agencies into a single database.  These data were analyzed to identify gaps in planning area data and were used to develop Phase II of the study.  Phase II involved an intensive data-collection effort by the USGS in cooperation with MMSD that completed a baseline assessment of water quality for selected stream and harbor sites in the MMSD planning area.  This baseline assessment included evaluations of surface-water chemistry and microbial concentrations in the streams and harbor sites, and bioassessments using passive samplers for synthetic organic chemicals (SPMDs), fish-tissue chemistry, stream habitat, and the quality of biological communities (fish, macroinvertebrates, and algae) at 14 wadable stream sites in 2004.  For Phase III, bioassessments were done again in 2007 and 2010 at most of the same stream sites. For Phase IV, bioassessments were done at 15 sites in 2013 and spring and early autumn sampling was done at a subset of three sites in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to evaluate temporal variation. Data analysis and reports are in progress for a Phase IV summary. Phase V began in 2016 and it includes bioassessments at 15 core ecological sites, including habitat, community (algal, invertebrate, and fish), and passive samplers. Additional sites were sampled in 2016 at restored stream sites and comparison to non-restored stream sites. All 15 core ecological sites and 3 restored stream sites were sampled again in 2019 for habitat and community (algal, invertebrate, and fish).

""Both NAWQA and USEPA have a need for ecological characterization of reference conditions to support the analysis and interpretation of data from their respected assessments, and other State agency and research institutions also have a need for reference site data.  NAWQA is currently supporting an effort to compile reference site data from the first National Stream Survey (2004), NAWQA studies (1993-2005), and other federal (e.g., USFS, BLM) and academic entities.   This has led to the development of a National Reference-Site Database (NRSD).The objective of this effort is to characterize reference-quality (or least-disturbed) conditions at sites in geographic areas that are currently underrepresented in the NRSD.""

The USGS National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program conducts water-quality assessments in major river basins and aquifers across the country. Major river basins and aquifers are referred to as NAWQA ""study units"". Assessments are done in cycles, where selected sets of study units are sampled intensively for three years followed successively by another 2 groups of study units. Once intensive sampling in all three groups of study units has been completed, a new cycle starts. Intensive sampling for Cycle I began in 1993, and the Western Lake Michigan Drainages (WMIC) unit was among the first group of study units. Cycle II began its planning phase in 2001, and the WMIC study unit completed intensive sampling during 2002-2004. Low-level sampling is in progress at a limited number of sites in WMIC while our efforts are focused on data analysis and report writing. Surface water-quality assessment for the WMIC occurred at 4 sites from 2002 through 2004 and at one site (the Popple River) from 2005 through 2006. Beginning in 2007, the surface-water and ecological sampling design for the WMIC was again revised to incorporate intermittent and rotational data collection at 3 sites (Popple River, Duck Creek and Lincoln Creek). Cycle III began in 2012. Since FY14, the Popple River near Fence is the only Wisconsin site that is sampled for ecology, and it is now sampled once a year in late summer/early fall.",National Water Quality Assessment,""

Public,Provisional,Silver Creek TNC Project,SilverTNC,USGS_BioData-000000010,Idaho Water Science Center,"The USGS, in cooperation with the sponsor, will conduct an assessment of habitat and biological characteristics in 2 stream reaches of Silver Creek including a site on the Preserve and at a downstream site near the USGS gage near Picabo. Since 1997 these study reaches have been sampled every 3 years to assess trends in aquatic resource conditions.  Instantaneous water quality parameters of pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature will be measured at the time of sampling. Macroinvertebrate semi-quantitative samples will be collected from riffle habitats in each study reach.  Macroinvertebrate taxa will be reported as number per unit area for riffle samples.  A qualitative sample will be done within each reach and the results will include a complete inventory of species collected. A fish community assessment will be made within the reach.  All fish captured will be identified, counted, measured and examined for external anomalies.  Microhabitat measures of riffle habitats will also be taken including velocity, depth, percent fines and embeddedness, and percent canopy opening.  Deliverables to the sponsor will include a tabulation of the data in excel spreadsheets.  The data will also be made available on the Idaho Water Science Center web site. Idaho Department of Fish and Game biologists and TNC volunteers will assist with fish sampling.

In 1997, the USGS joined the effort to monitor aquatic communities in the Silver Creek watershed. We measure streamflow, water-quality, and aquatic biology conditions and help assess whether habitation restoration efforts have been successful. With its partners, the USGS operates a streamgage on Silver Creek at the sportsman access near Picabo, ID. This gage collects discharge (flow), gage height, and temperature measurements every 15 minutes and disseminates them to the USGS National Water Information System Web Interface (NWIS Web) every hour. Every three years, we collect instantaneous water-quality samples to measure pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and temperature at this site and one further upstream. These data will be available on NWIS Web after they have been reviewed and approved.

During the instantaneous water-quality sample collection, USGS scientists and technicians also collect, identify, examine, and count macroinvertebrates and fish at the two Silver Creek sites to identify long-term trends in biological communities. Also, at riffles, we measure flow and depth; riverbed material (percent fines and embeddedness); and riparian growth (percent of canopy opening). Data collected prior to 2010 are available from the USGS Fish On-line Web site. Data collect after 2010 are available from the USGS BioData Web site.
Habitat restoration assessment.

The Nature Conservancy has made instream improvements in Patton Creek which is a tributary of Silver Creek. Since 2011, we have conducted seasonal macroinvertebrate assessments in three reaches of Patton Creek. We identify macroinvertebrate taxa (abundance per unit area). We also measure riffle microhabitat conditions such as water velocity and depth; riverbed material (percent fines and embeddedness); and riparian growth (percent of canopy opening). These data are available from the USGS BioData Web site. This assessment will be completed in 2013.",Cooperative Water Program,""
