Description:
    The package includes functions to access, extract, manipulate, and harmonize
    United States federal aquatic biomonitoring data, with a focus on
    macroinvertebrates and fish. This R package also provides functions to
    generate site-level information that may be of use in understanding the abiotic,
    contaminant, and land use drivers of dynamics of these biomonitoring data.
    The package streamlines the process of retrieving and working with these
    biomonitoring data, making it easier for researchers to utilize these
    unparalleled resources.
