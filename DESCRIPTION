Description:
    The package includes functions that provide access to, manipulate, and harmonize
    national-level aquatic biomonitoring datasets in the United States, with a
    focus on fish and macroinvertebrates sampled in rivers and streams. The
    package streamlines the process of retrieving and working with these data,
    making the process of utilizing these data  easier for researchers. The data
    resources used in this package are from United States Environmental Protection
    Agency’s National Aquatic Resources Surveys, namely the National River and
    Streams Assessment, and United States Geological Survey’s BioData.
