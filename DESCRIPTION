Description: For now, this R package is to be used only by members of the
    Powell Center working group led by Samantha Rumschlag. This R package
    provides functions to generate site by taxa matrices for macroinvertebrates,
    fish, and algae from USGS BioData along with the pertinent sample- and
    site-level information. Additionally, this R package provides functions to
    generate site-level information that may be of use in understanding the
    abiotic, contaminant, and land use drivers of dynamics of these communities.
