\title{finsyncR: An R Package to synchronize fish and invertebrate datasets from federal sources in the United States}
\description{
\code{finsyncR} (\strong{f}ish and \strong{in}vertebrate \strong{sync}hronizer in \strong{R}) flexibly
acquires, processes, and integrates national-level aquatic biomonitoring
datasets in the US, with a focus on fish and macroinvertebrates sampled in
rivers and streams. The package streamlines
the process of retrieving and working with these data, making the process of
utilizing these data  easier for researchers. The data resources used in this
package are from United States Environmental Protection Agency's National
Aquatic Resources Surveys, namely the National River and Streams Assessment,
and United States Geological Survey's BioData.

Data from USGS BioData were obtained from Pete Ruhl (pmruhl@usgs.gov), and
data from the National Aquatic Resource Surveys are directly downloaded by
the package from the \href{https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/data-national-aquatic-resource-surveys}{NARS website}.

Users should cite the aforementioned datasets as follows:

Nation: U.S. Geological Survey database, accessed 17 December 2020,
